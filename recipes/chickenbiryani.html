    <h2>About Biryani</h2>
    <p>Biryani is a mixed rice dish, mainly popular in South Asia. It is made with rice, some type of meat (chicken, goat, lamb, beef, prawn, or fish) and spices. To cater to vegetarians, in some cases, it is prepared by substituting vegetables or paneer for the meat. Sometimes eggs and/or potatoes are also added.</p>
    <p>Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia and among the South Asian diaspora, although the dish is often associated with the region's Muslim population in particular. Similar dishes are also prepared in other parts of the world such as in Iran, Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia. Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services, and has been labelled as the most popular dish overall in India</p>

    How to make chicken biryani (Pressure coocker method)
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Marinating Chicken</strong> Take 500 grams of cleaned chicken in a bowl. I am using skinless and bone-in chicken. Make sure you cut the chicken into medium pieces which cooks fast and stays moist. To the cleaned chicken, add in curd, salt, chilli powder, garam masala powder and ginger garlic paste. Mix well and set aside to marinate for at least 30 minutes. </li>
        <li><strong>Soaking Basmati Rice</strong> While the chicken is marinating. Wash 2 cups of basmati rice multiple times till water runs clear. Cover with fresh cold water and let it soak for 30 minutes. </li>
        <li><strong>Making Biryani Masala</strong> Take fennel seeds, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, mace, star anise in a blender and powder till coarse. This is your fresh masala for biryani.</li>
        <li><strong>Making Biryani Base</strong> Heat coconut oil and ghee in a kadai. Add in sliced onions and slit green chillies. Saute them till light golden in colour.</li>
        <li>Add in freshly ground ginger and garlic paste. Saute the ginger and garlic till raw smell leaves. It will take around 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add in chilli powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder and fresh garam masala powder.</li>
        <li>Saute the spice powders with onion for few seconds.</li>
        <li><strong>Cocking Chicken</strong> once masala is cooked, add in the marinated chicken.</li>
        <li>Saute the marinated chicken in the masala for at least 6 to 8 minutes. The chicken will be half cooked at this point. </li>
        <li>Take this chicken masala in a pressure cooker.</li>
        <li><strong>Roasting Rice</strong> In the same pan in which you made the chicken masala. Add a tbsp of ghee. </li>
        <li>Add in the 2 cups of soaked strained rice. Roast the rice for few minutes till it turns toasty and light golden in colour.</li>
        <li>Add in the roasted rice over the chicken masala which is kept in the pressure cooker.</li>
        <li><strong>Cooking Chicken Biryani</strong> Add in chopped coriander and mint leaves.</li>
        <li>Pour in 1 cup of coconut milk. <em>This is optional.</em> You can use water instead of coconut milk.</li>
        <li>Pour in 2 cups of water.</li>
        <li>Add salt to taste. </li>
        <li>Add salt to taste. </li>
        <li>Open the cooker and mix gently using a spatula or fork.</li>
        <li>Serve.</li>
